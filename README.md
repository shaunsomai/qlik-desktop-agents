## Resources

Cloud needs an external tenant MCP connector. Desktop needs Qlik Sense Desktop running and Python 3.8+; its MCP server is bundled. Both plugins can be installed together: inspect server-qualified tools and confirm the target app.

[Worked example](examples/sales-demo-desktop/) | [Themes](themes/) | [Developer Markdown](docs/qlik-developer-portal/README.md) | [Enterprise Windows reference](docs/qlik-sense-admin-playbook/README.md)

Reference libraries are retained in both repositories. Manage/REST/CLI target Cloud. Engine QIX and extension/theme topics also apply to Desktop. Enterprise Windows playbook content is server/migration reference. Publisher attribution and checksums remain intact; MIT covers original plugin code, not third-party documentation.

Examples are separate from installed plugins. Configure QVD folders and DEMO_QVDS_LOCAL before Desktop reloads; map connections for Cloud. Read the script porting contract.

## Validate and package

Repository tooling needs Python 3.10+; Desktop MCP runtime remains Python 3.8+.

    pip install requests
    python scripts/collect-qlik-dev.py --validate-only
    python scripts/package.py

Packaging checks manifests, agents, guide links, themes and Desktop MCP stdio/tool schemas offline, builds a ZIP with SHA-256 sidecar under dist/, then validates the extracted package. CI uploads these packages as artifacts. Live Qlik operations, rendering and Claude installation require their runtime environments.
